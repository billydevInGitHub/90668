      # when we are unit test one methods of sut, other method  could be mock, then spy is used here
         I think the implementation of spy is "interception of method" instead of totally replace the object

         Why use spy instead of mock?
         Testing Third-Party Libraries or APIs: Mockito Spy is beneficial when testing code that relies on third-party
         libraries or APIs. Instead of completely mocking these external dependencies, spy objects can retain the
         original behavior while selectively modifying or verifying specific methods relevant to the test case.

         When and why should a spy be used in Junit?
         Spies are useful when we have a huge class full of methods, and we want to mock certain methods. In this scenario,
         we should prefer using spies rather than mocks and stubs. It calls the real method behavior, if the methods are not
         stubbed.
