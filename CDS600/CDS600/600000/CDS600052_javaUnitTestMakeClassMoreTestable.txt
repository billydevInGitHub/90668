To test one big method, there will be many scenarios
        step 1   A B
        Step 2   C D
        Step 3   E F
        then we need test:  A C E,  A D E, B C E, B D E, ...
      # if we split each step into a method, then we need only test each method
          then each method has only 2 scenario to test

      # in the future in integration test, we might face same issue again,
         but in integration test we usually focus on key path of business logic
               focus what we really care about !!!
               we can use the mock to setup scenarios,corner case might not be important

                   seems also mentioned splitting will take advantage of setup and tear down
