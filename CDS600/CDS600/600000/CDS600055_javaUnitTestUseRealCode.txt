When the test is within cohesion domain we can use real code like file system ops code
    # usually we focus on logic, not the file system ops itself
    # difficult to do the mock than use file system
          # what we assert is the content of file system, mock usually mock the return code
    # why need within cohsion domain, because it does not call out, so no need to mock it
