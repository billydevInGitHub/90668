When the test is within cohesion domain we can use real code like file system ops code
    # especially we need new an instance the method to be tested, then we can not mock that new object !!!
           # check:
    # usually we focus on logic, not the file system ops itself
    # why need within cohsion domain, because it does not call out, so no need to mock it
