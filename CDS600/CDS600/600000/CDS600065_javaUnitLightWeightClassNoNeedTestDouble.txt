    If invoking Calculator::add doesn't significantly increase the time required to run the test (or any of the other important
    properties for this use case), then I wouldn't bother using a test double -- it doesn't provide benefits that outweigh the costs.

    Notice the two assumptions here: a human being as part of the cost evaluation, and the short stack of unverified changes in
    the benefit evaluation. In circumstances where those conditions do not hold, the value of "isolation" changes quite a bit.
    ===||    # myself: seems a balance between "the cost of test double" and "the isolation of the changes"
                       if the isolation of changes is not very complicated ( stack is not big or long)
                       we do not need bother to do the mock
