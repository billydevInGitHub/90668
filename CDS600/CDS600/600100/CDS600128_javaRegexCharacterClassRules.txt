Character Classes
Character classes may appear within other character classes, and may be composed by the union operator (implicit) and the intersection
operator (&&). The union operator denotes a class that contains every character that is in at least one of its operand classes. The
intersection operator denotes a class that contains every character that is in both of its operand classes.
            # I think union has 2 ways

The precedence of character-class operators is as follows, from highest to lowest:
            # I think highest will be considered first
1    	Literal escape    	\x
2    	Grouping	[...]
                # better to have some examples here
3    	Range	a-z
4    	Union	[a-e][i-u]
                # I think [a-ei-u] do the same
5    	Intersection	[a-z&&[aeiou]]
Note that a different set of metacharacters are in effect inside a character class than outside a character class. For instance,
the regular expression . loses its special meaning inside a character class, while the expression - becomes a range forming
metacharacter.
          # so metacharacters inside character class is different than outside character class ^_^
            good explanation and super good 2 examples here !!!
