FileWriter file = new FileWriter("foo.txt");
BufferedWriter bf = new BufferedWriter(file);
bf.write("foobar");
bf.close();

        BufferedWriter is more efficient if you

        have multiple writes between flush/close
        the writes are small compared with the buffer size.
            # so I think it can write to the memory
