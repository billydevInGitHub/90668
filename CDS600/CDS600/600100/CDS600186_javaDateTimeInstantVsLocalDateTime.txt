Instant and LocalDateTime are two entirely different animals:

One represents a moment, the other does not.

Instant
     represents a moment, a specific point in the timeline.

LocalDateTime
     represents a date and a time-of-day. But lacking a time zone or offset-from-UTC, this class cannot represent a moment.
     It represents potential moments along a range of about 26 to 27 hours, the range of all time zones around the globe.
     A LocalDateTime value is inherently ambiguous.

     # my understanding is: LocalDateTime is a "relative time" to one timezone while instant is an "absolute time"
             # LocalDateTime is important because people use them a lot, because when people talking about time, they usually
               have a "common sense" timezone
