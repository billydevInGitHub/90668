PipelineTestHelper helper
     # helper is initialized in BasePipelineTest.groovy
helper.addShMock(_subject.getSomeScript(), "someStdOutMsg", 0)
     # here exit code is 0, when DSL "execute to here", test framework know how to proceed
     # we get the script from subject, this might not be perfect ???
         getSomeScript() is kind of private/protected method
            #perfect solution is in test the script name is hard coded, but lots of typing
             and when the script name changed, test will fail
