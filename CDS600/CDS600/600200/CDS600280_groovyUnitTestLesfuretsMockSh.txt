PipelineTestHelper helper
     # helper is initialized in BasePipelineTest.groovy
helper.addShMock(_subject.getSomeScript(), "someStdOutMsg", 0)
     # here exit code is 0
     # we get the script from subject, this might not be perfect ???
         getSomeScript() is kind of private/protected method
