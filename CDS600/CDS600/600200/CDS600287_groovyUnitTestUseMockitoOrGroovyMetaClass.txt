Mockito do mocking better than Groovy metaClass
     # groovy closure is also a convenient way to do the mock,
     # problems when using groovy metaClass
           static might have thread issue
           Mockito provided more features than metaClass like spy, argument captor etc.

Lesfurets framework has something to deal with the DSL while mockito does not have this feature ;
