        seems:
        ===
          In Java == means equality of primitive types or identity for objects.
          In Groovy == means equality in all cases. It translates to a.compareTo(b) == 0,
          when evaluating equality for Comparable objects, and a.equals(b) otherwise.
          To check for identity (reference equality), use the is method: a.is(b).
          From Groovy 3, you can also use the === operator (or negated version): a === b (or c !== d).
