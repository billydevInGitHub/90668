1 When JDK upgrade, junit can find code difference in source code level
     # because unit test went through most important code in this repo

2 review and optimize code
     # several times I found code issues

3 keep core business logic, good for refactoring

5 for those dynmic type languages, unit test can help catch the runtime errors
    # see CDS600358,  errors of dynamic typing might happen in runtime ( compile time can not find the errors)
