INPUT_LIST.sort(false){(it as String).charAt(0)}.reverse(false)
      # Here’s the Groovy version of sorting a List of Strings according to the first characters of each String in reverse order:
      # The two boolean parameters with value false will make sure sorting is executed on a copy of the list, not on the original.

      # At the moment, #sort(…) breaks type inference, thus it must be casted to String explicitly. This is a known bug.
