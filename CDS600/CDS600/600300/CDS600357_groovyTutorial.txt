         Groovy is simple for Java developers since the syntax for Java and Groovy are very similar.
                # groovy is extension of java, that means java source code is "valid" in groovy
                        so groovy has more "syntax" than java
         You can use existing Java libraries.
                # I think they both compiled to byte code, in byte code level they are the same
         Groovy extends the java.lang.Object.
