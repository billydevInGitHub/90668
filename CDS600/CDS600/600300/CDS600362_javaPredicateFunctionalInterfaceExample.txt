List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Angela", "Aaron", "Bob", "Claire", "David");

List<String> namesWithA = names.stream()
  .filter(name -> name.startsWith("A"))
  .collect(Collectors.toList());

        # again this is framework version, the filter and collect is the framework
          implementation, the filter provide something like an element, need a result ^_^
          so here we can not see the interface method was called because we did not
          provide the part that framework call the functional interface

        # interface definition:
            boolean test(T t)
               # so it accepts an element and gives the result
                 we can only see the test method called when framework call interface !!
