Output:
true
This method returns a UnaryOperator which takes in one value and returns it. The returned UnaryOperator does not perform any operation on
    its only value. Syntax:
static  UnaryOperator identity()
           # this is the extra method for unary operator interface
Parameters: This method does not take in any parameter. Returns: A UnaryOperator which takes in one value and returns it.
           # interesting thing is : its return is a functional interface , similar to andThen and compose
                      # still need a bit more time to understand the usage of those methods
