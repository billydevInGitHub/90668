For example, take this code:

if (!map.containsKey(key))
   return map.put(key, value);
else
   return map.get(key);
In a multi-thread environment, this is a race condition. You have to use the ConcurrentHashMap.putIfAbsent(K key, V value)
   and pay attention to the return value, which tells you if the put operation was successful or not. Read the docs for
   more details.
