    #  Using the Files class, we can create, move, copy, and delete files and directories. It can also be used to read and write to a file:
          # I think this is a convenient way or tool to do File related operations
          # I think it should use default encoding, so actually it is both bytes and text writing
    #  Use Files class from Java 1.7 to write files, internally uses OutputStream
