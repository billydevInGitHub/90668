=== Creating Stream (seems all collection and map convert to stream first)

Convert to
Stream
    array to      CDS600075
    stream        (File[] to
                   stream)

    map to        CDS600180
    stream        (map entrySet
                   to stream)

    OtherStream   CDS600086
    to stream     (int range
                   to Stream)
